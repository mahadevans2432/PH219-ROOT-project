# PH219 ROOT Project

In this repository you can find ROOT macros that were used to study the characteristics of transverse momentum and look at the trends of standardized and intensive skewness and standardized variance of p-p collisions at centre of mass energy = 13 Tev generated using Pythia 8 Monte Carlo event generator. Analysis is done for different multiplicity classes. Here STAR method is used for skewness analysis.
